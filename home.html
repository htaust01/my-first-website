         <h2 class="sections">The history of the Rubik's cube</h2>
         <p>The Rubik's Cube is a 3-D combination puzzle originally invented in 1974 by Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture Ern≈ë Rubik. Originally called the Magic Cube, the puzzle was licensed by Rubik to be sold by Ideal Toy Corp in 1980 via businessman Tibor Laczi and Seven Towns founder Tom Kremer. The cube was released internationally in 1980 and became one of the most recognized icons in popular culture. It won the 1980 German Game of the Year special award for Best Puzzle. As of January 2009, 350 million cubes had been sold worldwide,making it the world's bestselling puzzle game and bestselling toy. (copied from wikipedia)</p>

         <h2 class="sections">One method for solving the cube</h2>
         <p>You can solve the cube in layers. First choose one side to solve and align the edge pieces first then the corners. That solves one layer. For the middle layer solve the edge pieces using special combination moves that preserve the first layer. Finally solve the third layer by first making the cross with the edges, then put the edges in the correct places, then finally solve the corners; all while preserving the two layers you solved. </p>
